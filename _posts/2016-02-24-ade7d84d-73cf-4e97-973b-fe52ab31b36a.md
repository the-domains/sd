An interface has to work as you expect and has to look good. Everybody thinks so! Luckily there are designers like me on this planet to make sure it does. A great experience for the end user and the satisfaction of the customer are my goals. Often these go hand in hand. By designing from functionality and user perspective, I get the best results.
