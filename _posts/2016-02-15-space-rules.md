2015 was a big year for the popularity of space. So perhaps you'll forgive NASA if the space agency wants to capitalize on that momentum with some stellar new artwork. Today, Seattle design firm Invisible Creature --- which has done work for clients like Nike, Seattle Weekly, Target, and many more --- released three gorgeous new space-themed travel posters commissioned by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory for a 2016 calendar that will be given to NASA staff, scientists, engineers, and government officials. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4718ceb5-f93b-42fe-8812-e4daa5f07302.png)

JPL will also release digital copies of each month's artwork for free, but you can buy physical prints of Invisible Creature's posters on the firm's website. The idea is not terribly new --- JPL has commissioned posters, infographics, and other artwork in the past, and you can dig through a pretty extensive archive on the lab's website. But there is something striking about Invisible Creature's posters and the detail they involve. Each one rewards closer inspection and repeat viewings thanks to some clever design.
